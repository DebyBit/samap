						<h3>Surety Bond</h3>

		<p>Surety Bond is vital financial instrument (such as Collateral) from an insurance company which you pledge as security for the loan, the insurance company becomes your official loan guarantor.</p>

		<p>In the event that you could not repay the loan for any reason, your lender receive the loan fund amount with the interest from the insurance company on your behalf.</p>

		<p>Surety Bond Collateral is extremely important part of Soft Loan Financing in line with The World Bank rules and regulations, which removes the entire burden of loan repayment on the borrower, thereby making it very easier for the lender to recoup the invested loan funds successfully at the end of the loan term duration.</p>
