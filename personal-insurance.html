		<p>Constancy Real International Insurance LLC is one of the largest car insurance providers in the UAE and we &nbsp;probably insure almost every other car you see on Road &nbsp;these days. Our scale and reputation of being a leading broker since &nbsp;1993 allow us to be in a position to negotiate the best deals for you &nbsp;and provide you with an option to choose from all of the leading car &nbsp;insurance companies. In the car insurance domain, we work &nbsp;with brand names such as AIG, RSA, AXA, Oman, Qatar, Tokio, New India, &nbsp;NGI, ADNIC, Oriental and more &ndash; on exclusive scheme terms that you &nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t be able to procure from them directly.</p>

		<p>We only work with first class providers &ndash; people on whom we can count on at the time of a claim. What&rsquo;s great about buying from Constancy Real International is that &nbsp;regardless of which insurer you choose, you are guaranteed outstanding &nbsp;claims service. We provide you with your own dedicated claims manager &nbsp;from our office in the unlucky event that your car is in an accident and we would guide you and support you through what can otherwise become &nbsp;quite a tedious process. Insurance companies are commonly bad-mouthed &nbsp;for trying to avoid paying out for a reason! Constancy Real International solves that problem &nbsp;and takes away the stress of getting things done at the time of a claim &ndash; a much-needed service especially in a place like the UAE where &nbsp;everybody is almost always just too busy.</p>

		<p>After you enquire on the form on the right (please give us as much &nbsp;info as you can so that we can put together the most accurate proposals &nbsp;for you), you would typically hear back from us within a few hours with a choice of quotes. &nbsp;Buying your insurance then would just take a few minutes.

Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll also have a dedicated insurance &nbsp;advisor from our office to help you make your choice and take you &nbsp;through this simple purchase process!</p>
