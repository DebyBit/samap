						<h2>Banker&#39;s blanket bond Insurance&nbsp;</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Banker&rsquo;s Blanket Bond is a specialist insurance policy which covers &nbsp;the external and internal risk exposure of banks and other financial &nbsp;institutions. It protects the assets and liabilities of the banks &nbsp;against losses from criminal acts performed by their own employees.</p>

		<p><strong>This type of insurance provides coverage for the following:</strong>
			<br>&nbsp;●Employee Infidelity
			<br>&nbsp;●Office, contents and premises protection
			<br>&nbsp;●Forgery and Falsification of Documents
			<br>&nbsp;●Stealing &amp; Larceny
			<br>&nbsp;● Computer and funds transfer fraud
			<br>&nbsp;●Loss/Damage to property while in transit
			<br>&nbsp;●Counterfeited currency</p>

		<p>There are great risks associated with the operations of banks and &nbsp;other financial institutions. Therefore, a correct insurance and &nbsp;comprehensive insurance protection will be able to help these businesses &nbsp;operate effectively knowing that they have an additional level of &nbsp;security and protection.</p>

		<h2>Jewellers block insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Because jewelries have high value, simple property insurance cannot provide coverage and protection for it.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Jeweller&rsquo;s block is a comprehensive all risk insurance policy for &nbsp;businesses dealing with precious metals and stones. High value art and &nbsp;antiques can also be covered in this type of policy. Retailers, &nbsp;merchandisers and manufacturers of these products are exposed to risk of &nbsp;theft, burglary, loss and damage to property.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Jeweler&rsquo;s Block can specifically cover the following risk exposures:</strong>
			<br>&nbsp;&ndash;Displays in Showroom
			<br>&nbsp;&ndash;Personal Carrying
			<br>&nbsp;&ndash;Products in Transit
			<br>&nbsp;&ndash;Entrustment to a Third Party</p>

		<p>A single loss or damage to your high value properties can have a &nbsp;great impact on your business. Jeweler&rsquo;s Block policy can provide you &nbsp;peace of mind knowing that you have the right protection from any future &nbsp;disaster.</p>

		<h2>Cyber risk insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Protect your business from financial losses and legal suits arising from cyber crimes and hacking!</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s businesses strongly rely on IT infrastructure. From storing &nbsp;data to performing transactions, everything can be done with the use of &nbsp;the internet. That is why cyber crimes impose a great risk for all &nbsp;businesses.</p>

		<p>If you are a business which holds sensitive customer details such as &nbsp;names and addresses or banking information, you might find yourself in &nbsp;trouble when a hacker gets a hold of this information. You may lose your &nbsp;customers, but worse, you might find yourself in legal trouble.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;Businesses that rely on their websites to perform their business &nbsp;transactions can have financial losses due to business interruption when &nbsp;their websites are shut down by hackers.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t let your business be victimized by these cyber criminals. Insure your business against these cyber risks!</p>
