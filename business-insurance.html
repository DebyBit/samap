						<h2>Property insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>This standard business policy covers the physical property and equipment against all common risks.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<hr>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Business interruption insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>When insuring for a loss, it is most important to think about the risks of the resulting consequential loss. We can design our policies to accurately insure the business against loss of gross income or profits and commissions if preferred. Whilst the property insurance will cover building&rsquo;s contents, this policy aims to make sure the business does not suffer as a result of an external occurance. This is often included in wider business policies, rather than alone.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<hr>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Product Liability Insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In the event of a product malfunctioning or failing to be safe, insurance against this can be taken out to fund its withdrawal, counter the subsequent loss of income and resolve any claims disputes.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<hr>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>&nbsp;Public liability insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>This general coverage aims to protect the business against third party claims, such as negligence, injury, damage or loss. This insurance is compulsory for all companies.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<hr>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Life Insurance for Groups</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Constancy Real International Insurance LLC Employee Benefits team would be happy to setup a Group Life insurance policy for you. In the UAE, this is a very popular policy, typically put in place as an upgrade over and above the basic Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation policy. It would provide a compensation to the company and/or the family members of an employee in the event of their death, disablement or critical illness (based on the policy that we structure for you). The compensation amount may be a flat amount based on employee category or a multiple of their annual salary.</p>

		<p>Individual employees usually find it difficult and expensive to put their life insurance place whilst they work in the UAE and a Group Life insurance from their employer would certainly be an attractive perk for them as part of their overall benefits package &ndash; especially given the extremely low cost and administrative effort involved in putting a Group Life insurance in place. Often, we may be able to bolt on the Life benefit to your Group Health plan as well. Please speak with your advisor from Constancy Real International Insurance LLC for more information.</p>

		<h2>Group travel insurance</h2>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Do you have employees who have to travel for work? Why not put in place a Group Travel policy that would easily cover all your employees whilst they travel, chargeable only for the total number of days travelled in a year &ndash; across all your staff. Typically, a group travel policy works out to be significantly more efficient and effective in terms of cost and administrative requirements than an individual policy having to be purchased for each employee&rsquo;s trip.</p>

		<p>Get in touch and let us know about your requirements &ndash; we&rsquo;d be happy to create a bespoke solution for you. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>At Constancy Real International Insurance LLC, we have specialist knowledge and infrastructure to manage livestock insurance policies. We are known to be the leading brokers for some of the largest dairy companies in the UAE.</p>
